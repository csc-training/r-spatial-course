# STAC R examples

The [STAC](https://stacspec.org/en/) is a specification to describe geospatial information, so it can easily **searched and downloaded**. 
STAC includes metadata of datasets and links to actual files, the data files are usually stored in the cloud. See [Paituli STAC page](https://paituli.csc.fi/stac.html) for general introduction about STAC and what Collections (=datasets) are included in Paituli STAC.

In this repository we provide examples to work with:

* [Paituli STAC API](STAC_CSC_example.R)
* See, also similar [Python STAC examples]([../../python/STAC](https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/python/STAC))

The examples mainly cover data search and download, using [rstac](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstac/index.html). For analyzing data [gdalcubes](https://gdalcubes.github.io/) or [terra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html) can be used.  When working with bigger datasts, gdalcubes supports also parallelization.

The examples can be run on any computer with R installation. The required R packages can be seen from the beginning of the example scripts. The examples download all data from cloud storage, so relatively good internet connection is needed. For using data in JP2000 format, GDAL must be installed with JP2000-support.

It is possible to try this script also in CSC Puhti supercomputer. The easiest option is to start RStudio in Puhti web interface. For learning STAC, it is recommended to reserve 1 core and 8 Gb memory. Data analysis part with gdalcubes would benefit from more cores. Currently Puhti r-env does not support JP2000 format, so sentinel2-l2a can not be used with gdalcubes. Searching all collections works.

In CSC Puhti supercomputer, the examples can be run with [r-env module](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/), which includes all necessary R packages. The easiest is to use RStudio with Puhti web interface:

* Open [Puhti web interface](https://www.puhti.csc.fi/)
* Click "RStudio" on dashboard
* Select following settings:
	* Project: project_2002044 during course, own project otherwise 
	* Partition: interactive
	* Number of CPU cores: 1
	* Memory (Gb): 8 
	* Local disk (GB): 0
	* Time: 1:00:00 (or adjust to reasonable)
* Click launch and wait until granted resources 
* Click "Connect to RStudio Server" 


If you want to run the example on your own computer, you'll need RStudio installed, along with the following packages: ```geojsonsf, sf, terra, tidyverse, rstac, httr, gdalcubes```. 

Download the example code to your computer (either by copying the whole repository to your computer with git (`git clone https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing.git`) or by downloading only the needed file via github webinterface (find `STAC_CSC_example.Rmd` and in the upper right corner of the file "Download raw file button").
