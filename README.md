# Repository for CSC 'Spatial data analysis with R' course 

The aim of this course is to familiarize participants with spatial analysis with R. 
All materials by Marko Kallio (Aalto University).

## Contents
### Day 1, vector basics
* D1S1 Handling and plotting vector data in R
* D1S2 Handling and plotting cont.
* D1S3 Spatial operations (intersection, clipping, conversions etc)
* D1S4 Spatial operations cont.
 
### Day 2, vector data analysis and visualization
* D2S1 Spatial analysis of vector data (clustering, density surfaces, autocorrelation)
* D2S2 Spatial analysis cont.
* D2S3 Visualizing spatial data

### Day 3, raster basics
* D2S1 Raster basics with R
* D3S2 Raster data manipulation
* D3S3 Map algebra
* D3S4 Spatial modelling with raster data

### Self-study options
* Vector data exercises (Days 1  and 2) should be done in the given order, with possibility to skip to visualization before finishing some of the sessions before it.
* Raster data exercises (Day 3) can be done as own module, without doing the vector data exercises. 

## Prerequisites
* Basics of geoinformatics and geostatistics
* Basic use of R, no earlier experience with R spatial packages is needed. For self-study [Data analysis with R course material](https://github.com/csc-training/da-with-r-remote) can be used.
